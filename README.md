This is a fractal program with python code used from https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/programming-fractals-in-python-d42db4e2ed33 written by Monique Cheng.
Lohen added variable declarations, and sent the code to Harlee, who then created a git repo for this project. I'm working on the best way to use github to collaborate effectively, and I've forked the repo.
